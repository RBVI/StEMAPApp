StEMAP (Structural EMAP) App is designed to take an existing 
network that resulted from a CDT import, then perform the
following tasks:
	1) Find all nodes with residue identifiers and create attributes
	   that structureViz can associate with the corresponding structure
	2) Read in a PDB file and associate the residues in the structure
	   with nodes in Cytoscape
